;; ## Context

;; We're going to be re-describing things in terms of context.
;; Context includes configuration and contextual information about where things are.
;; But it is extensible, so we can pass through whatever information we might like about how to render things.

;; All of these should be checked for their semantics on :dat.view.base-context/value etc; Is this the right way to represent these things?

;; Should probably move all of these out to reactions or some such, except for anything that's considered public
